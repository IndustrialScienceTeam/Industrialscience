BASE CONCEPT

-The addition of a tiered and balanced automining system


Ideas for the distinct game Phases:

EARLY GAME

-The addition of a Block allowing the player to convert useless things to valuable ores
	-A sluice would suit this Idea

MIDDLE AND LATE GAME

-The addition of several tiered Blocks which work as a virtual Miner
	-The Blocks would consume Energy and convert this to ores
	-These would only mine the biome-specific ores of the biome it is standing in
	-A balancefeature could be the addition of a probability for the miner to mine cobblestone/dirt/gravel instead of ores
	-A dungeon-exclusive item could be needed in order to craft this, while the item would be consumed in the crafting process, limiting the number of these blocks
	-Another balanchefeature would be a probability of these blocks to break, so they void the inputted energy and do not produce ores until they are fixed MANUALLY
	-This problem would be able to be partially fixed by adding certain upgrades which would be unlocked as the game progresses
	-later these would be made multiblocks by us
	-We will add a multiblock construction table for these blocks later
	-machines should be partially self-explanatory

Tier which hasn't got anything to do with the rest of the mod

-The addition of mod-own conveyor belts as well as worldgen-liquids and tiered multiblocks
